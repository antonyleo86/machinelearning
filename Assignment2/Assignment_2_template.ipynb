    "One of the reasons why Google is such an effective search engine is the PageRank algorithm developed by Google‘s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. PageRank is determined entirely by the link structure of the World Wide Web. It is recomputed about once a month and does not involve the actual content of any Web pages or individual queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine surfing the Web, going from page to page by randomly choosing an outgoing link from one page to get to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "The limiting probability that an infinitely dedicated random surfer visits any particular page is its PageRank. Google models the network of Web pages by a Markov chain. It regards the network as a huge Markov Chain, where every state is a page.\n",
    "The conclusion we will arrive at is that the page ranks are proportional to the stationary probabilities of the states in the Markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, if you wander around the Web pages randomly according to this Markov chain, after a long time, the probability of visiting any page at any time converges, and this probability is not affected by how you start your navigation.\n",
    "The higher the probability is, the higher the rank of the page will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the simplified WWW in figure, it has 4 web-pages that correspond to 4 different news-site (CNN, HP, NYT and WP). Inside the pages, in blue, you can see the links to the other pages. For instance in page 1, there are 7 links, 2/7 are to CNN, 1/7 to HP, 3/7 to NYT and 1/7 to WP.\n",

Add a counter $C=[c_{CNN},c_{HP},c_{NYT},c_{WP}]$ that counts the number of times the surfer visits the four pages and show that when the number of total clicks becomes large then  $C/(c_{CNN}+c_{HP}+c_{NYT}+c_{WP})$ converges to a specific vector of probability. This vector gives the Pagerank.\n",
